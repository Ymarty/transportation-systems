Call to Action
---------------
`What do we know today that can guide the Transportation Infrastructure for Smart Cities of Tomorrow?`

Project Background
-------------------
All around the Nation, Transportation issues are increasingly impacting the lives of everyday citizens. As the Portland Metro region continues to grow, our infrastructure feels this strain. As populations rise and streets become more crowded, augmenting our travel with the many alternative modes of Transportation the City has to offer is critical. Through the successes of CIVIC, the Hack Oregon Transportation Team is committed to providing insights and solutions into the ever-growing problems surrounding Transportation in the Portland area and beyond.
